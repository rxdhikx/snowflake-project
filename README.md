# Real-Time Analytics with Snowflake ⛅📊  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time analytics pipeline using **Snowflake's Modern Data Cloud**, focusing on integrating and processing structured data efficiently. The notebooks in this repository showcase **data ingestion, transformation, and analysis** using **Snowpark, Snowflake CLI, and Python-based workflows**.  

## Problem Statement  
Companies deal with massive amounts of data stored in different sources, such as **S3, spreadsheets, and external APIs**. Traditional ETL pipelines often suffer from:  
✅ **Slow data ingestion**  
✅ **Complex data transformation steps**  
✅ **High infrastructure and scaling costs**  

### Use Case  
A **retail company** wants to analyze how **daily weather impacts city-wise sales** to optimize inventory and pricing strategies. This project demonstrates how to:  
🔹 Load and preprocess **daily sales and weather data**  
🔹 Build an **automated data pipeline** using **Snowpark**  
🔹 Perform real-time analytics efficiently in **Snowflake**  

## Project Components  

### 1️⃣ **snowpark_notebook.ipynb**  
📌 **Purpose**: Demonstrates how to use **Snowpark for Python** to perform data transformations in Snowflake.  
📌 **Key Features**:  
- Read and write data in **Snowflake tables**  
- Apply **Python-based transformations** using Snowpark DataFrames  
- Use **optimized execution plans** for performance  

### 2️⃣ **load_excel_files.ipynb**  
📌 **Purpose**: Loads structured data from Excel files into Snowflake for further processing.  
📌 **Key Features**:  
- Parses **Excel files** and extracts data  
- Uses **Snowflake's Python Connector** to insert data  
- Ensures data integrity with **schema validation**  

### 3️⃣ **load_daily_city_metrics.ipynb**  
📌 **Purpose**: Automates daily ingestion of city-wise sales and weather data.  
📌 **Key Features**:  
- Fetches daily **city sales and weather metrics**  
- Loads data into a **Snowflake table** for real-time analytics  
- Handles **incremental updates** and ensures **data consistency**
